    """
    This class represents a process for model inference in the Practice App.

    Attributes:
        logger (Logger): The logger instance for logging messages.
        holt_winter_model_path (str): The file path of the Holt-Winter model.
        prophet_model_path (str): The file path of the Prophet model.
        test_data_path (str): The file path of the test data.

    Methods:
        __init__(logger, holt_winter_model_path, prophet_model_path, test_data_path):
            Initializes the PracticeAppModelInference with the provided parameters.

        load_models():
            Loads the Holt-Winter and Prophet models from their respective paths.

        load_test_data():
            Loads the test data from the specified path.

        perform_inference():
            Performs inference on the loaded models using the test data.

        print_predictions():
            Prints the predicted values of the test data for both models.
