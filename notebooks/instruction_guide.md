# Energy and Sales Demand Forecasting Notebooks

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for forecasting energy and sales demand using time series analysis.

## Setup and Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- Jupyter Notebook installed (you can install it via pip or conda)
- Git installed (if you plan to clone the repository)

### Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
